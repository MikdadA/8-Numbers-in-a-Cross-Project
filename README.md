The 8 Numbers in a Cross puzzle is a distinctive challenge that necessitates arranging eight numbers within a distinct shape.
The task is to position the numbers in a way that ensures no two adjacent numbers follow each other.
By "follow," we mean that the numbers should not be in immediate succession when counting, 
for example we want to avoid situations where 1 is adjacent to 0 and 2, or 6 is adjacent to 5 and 7.
